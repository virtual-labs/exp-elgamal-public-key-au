{
"question": "What are the key components of the ElGamal public key cryptosystem?",
"options": [
"a. Symmetric key and public key",
"b. Private key and shared key",
"c. Public key and private key",
"d. Public key and session key"
],
"explanation": {
"a": "Incorrect. ElGamal does not use a symmetric key in its public key cryptosystem.",
"b": "Incorrect. ElGamal involves a private key but not a shared key.",
"c": "Correct. The ElGamal public key cryptosystem consists of a public key (g, p, y) and a private key (x).",
"d": "Incorrect. ElGamal does not utilize a session key in its key components."
},
"correctAnswer": "c",

},
{
"question": "In ElGamal, what is the public key composed of?",
"options": [
"a. (g, x, p)",
"b. (p, x, g)",
"c. (g, p, y)",
"d. (p, y, g)"
],
"explanation": {
"a": "Incorrect. The correct form of the ElGamal public key is (g, p, y).",
"b": "Incorrect. The correct form of the ElGamal public key is (g, p, y).",
"c": "Correct. The public key in ElGamal is (g, p, y), where y is calculated as (g^x) mod p.",
"d": "Incorrect. The correct form of the ElGamal public key is (g, p, y)."

{
"question": "During ElGamal encryption, what does 'a' represent in the ciphertext (a, b)?",
"options": [
"a. Random integer",
"b. Shared secret",
"c. Generator of the group",
"d. Inverse of the private key"
],
"explanation": {
"a": "Correct. 'a' in the ciphertext (a, b) represents a random integer used in the encryption process.",
"b": "Incorrect. 'a' in the ciphertext does not represent a shared secret.",
"c": "Incorrect. 'a' in the ciphertext is not the generator of the group.",
"d": "Incorrect. 'a' in the ciphertext is not the inverse of the private key."
